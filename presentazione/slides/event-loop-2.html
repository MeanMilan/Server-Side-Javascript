<h2>Event loop - 2</h2>

<ul>
    <li>A JavaScript runtime contains a message queue, which is a list of messages to be processed</li>
    <li>To each message is associated a function. When the stack is empty, a message is taken out of the queue and processed.</li>
    <li>The processing consists of calling the associated function (and thus creating an initial stack frame). </li>
    <li>The message processing ends when the stack becomes empty again.
    </li>
</ul>
