<h2>Non-blocking I/O analogy</h2>

<ul>
    <li>As soon as you place your order, it’s sent off for someone to fulfill while the cashier is still taking your payment.</li>
    <li>When you are done paying, you have to step aside because the cashier is already looking to service the next customer.</li>
    <li>When your food is set, the cashier – or someone – will signal you by calling out your name,  (callback)</li>
</ul>
